    "ESTIMATING IF EITHER ASK OR SHOW POSTS GET MORE COMMENTS THAN THE OTHER AND THE INFLUENCE OF TIME ON NUMBER OF COMMENTS \n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "Hacker News is a site by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments. It is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used was goten from dataquest and it is approximately 20,000 rows, generated by removing all submissions that didn't receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "id: the unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "title: the title of the post\n",
    "url: the URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL\n",
    "num_points: the number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "num_comments: the number of comments on the post\n",
    "author: the username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "created_at: the date and time of the post's submission\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest is in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\n",
    "Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\n",
    "Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, users also submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Show HN: Wio Link ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\n",
    "Show HN: Something pointless I made\n",
    "Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",
    "\n",
    "OBJECTIVE\n",
    "These two types of posts will be used to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
